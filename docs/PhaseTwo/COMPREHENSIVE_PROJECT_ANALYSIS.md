**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Fundraiser event is August 2, 2025  
**Mitigation:** Start immediately, focus on MVP first, add enhancements iteratively

### Risk 3: Scope Creep

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Premium features take significant time  
**Mitigation:** Define clear MVP, phase enhancements, manage expectations

### Risk 4: Browser Compatibility

**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Complex animations may not work on older browsers  
**Mitigation:** Test early, provide fallbacks, focus on modern browsers
