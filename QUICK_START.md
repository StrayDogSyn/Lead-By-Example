## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### The "Urban Evolution" Story

The Evolution Journey component brings to life the transformation from at-risk youth to successful community member - inspired by the classic "evolution of man" display, but reimagined for urban youth.

**5 Stages of Transformation:**

1. 🚨 At-Risk Youth (Red) - The challenge
2. ⚖️ Struggle & Crossroads (Orange) - Critical moment
3. 🤝 Lead By Example Intervention (Cape Verdean Green) - The solution
4. 🌱 Growth & Learning (Royal Purple) - Development
5. 🏆 Achievement & Leadership (Brilliant Gold) - Success

### Trauma-Informed Design

Every component follows evidence-based trauma-informed design principles:

- **Calming colors** - No harsh or triggering visuals
- **User control** - Choices and autonomy throughout
- **Safety indicators** - Verified badges and trust signals
- **Strengths-based** - Focus on potential and success
